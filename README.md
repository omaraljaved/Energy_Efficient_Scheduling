## Description:
In manufacturing systems, optimizing production scheduling is crucial for efficient resource utilization and meeting production targets. This project focuses on addressing sustainability concerns by minimizing energy consumption in the scheduling process. The algorithm takes into account factors such as machine setup times, processing rates, and energy profiles to generate optimal schedules.

## Features:
1. PSO algorithm implementation for energy-efficient production scheduling.
2. Customizable parameters such as the number of particles, iterations, and job/machine specifications.
3. Fitness function that considers both makespan (completion time) and energy consumption.
4. Visualization of the optimal schedule's energy consumption.

## Output:
The bar chart illustrates the energy consumption distribution across the optimal production schedule generated using the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. Each bar corresponds to a job, showcasing its energy consumption on various machines within the manufacturing system. The chart highlights the achieved energy-efficient scheduling to minimize overall energy usage while meeting production constraints.
